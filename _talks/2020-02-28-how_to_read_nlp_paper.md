For most beginner or students major in NLP, they can not got the experience of searching, collecting and reading research paper. Unfortainately, a lots tutors also are not able to teach their students(for some university which never do NLP research before).

This is one part of our admission training for new graduate students, I do this talk and record it for our own use, and also hope to help others.
